  <strong>Turning Houses into Homes, One Piece at a Time.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  At <span class="highlight">Adopt Furniture</span>, we believe every piece of
  furniture has a story. From the cozy armchair in the reading nook to the
  dining table that's seen countless family dinners, each item holds memories
  and moments. Yet, when it's time to let go, these pieces can still bring joy
  and comfort to another home.
